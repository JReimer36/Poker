# Poker
Program to accept input of poker cards by each phase of a hand, and return the probabilities of getting each possible hand as an outcome after the river
<br> <b>Straight calculations are broken, only counts amount of cards in a row but NOT those separated by a missing card (i.e will count [2,3,4,5] as one card away but [2,3,5,6] as two cards away from a straight)  </b>
